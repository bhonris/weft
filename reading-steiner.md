original_prompt: "Build Weft — a cross-platform (Windows-first) Electron desktop app with a VS Code-style interface built around browser-style tabs of Claude Code CLI sessions (one tab per project), an integrated file explorer, per-tab Claude session status awareness driven by Claude Code hooks, Monaco read-only+diff viewer, tear-off tabs into separate windows, workspace persistence, and app-owned OS notifications. React+TS+Vite renderer, node-pty terminals via xterm.js, electron-store persistence. Full design at documents/claude-terminal-ide.md."

decisions:
  - architecture: "BETA worldline — shared/ (pure IPC contract) + core/ (pure logic: status-mapper, reducers, migrations, correlator, throttle) + main/ (thin Electron adapters + platform/ seams for named-pipe vs UDS + DI container) + preload/ (typed bridge) + renderer/ (React+zustand). PTY lives in main, renderer is a view over main's truth. Beta chosen over Alpha for multi-concern app + 95% coverage bar + cross-platform seam + v2 roadmap."
  - testing: "vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 (95%/90% thresholds), projects api (node + jsdom); business logic pure & tested via injected fakes (FakePty, FakePlatform, fake store); Playwright for Electron E2E; manual ConPTY/TUI verification on Windows"
  - stack: "TypeScript, Electron 34 + electron-vite 3, pnpm, React 19 + Vite 6 renderer, zustand 5, xterm.js 5.5, chokidar 4, electron-store 10, monaco 0.52, dockview 4, zod 3, node-pty (deferred native install)"
