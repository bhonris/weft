original_prompt: "Build Weft — a cross-platform (Windows-first) Electron desktop app with a VS Code-style interface built around browser-style tabs of Claude Code CLI sessions (one tab per project), an integrated file explorer, per-tab Claude session status awareness driven by Claude Code hooks, Monaco read-only+diff viewer, tear-off tabs into separate windows, workspace persistence, and app-owned OS notifications. React+TS+Vite renderer, node-pty terminals via xterm.js, electron-store persistence. Full design at documents/claude-terminal-ide.md. CYCLE 6 END GOAL (operator): fully mouseless, keyboard-only navigation across all of Weft; macOS/Linux platform work OUT OF SCOPE this cycle."

current_focus: "Expansion 6 AC3 (command palette). Build src/renderer/components/CommandPalette.tsx: a focus-trapped modal opened by Ctrl+Shift+P, backed by COMMANDS + fuzzyFilter, with role=listbox/option + aria-activedescendant, a search input (autofocus), ↑/↓ move highlight, Enter runs the selected command's injected handler, Esc closes and RESTORES focus to the previously-active element. Also make the App window keydown listener robust: only preventDefault/act on KeyActions it actually handles (so newly-routed-but-unwired chords fall through to the PTY), and wire: command-palette → open palette; keep existing tab chords. A small command-dispatch map (id → handler) lives in the renderer. Add a jsdom test for palette filter/keyboard-select/Esc-restore/aria."

decisions:
  - architecture: "BETA worldline — shared/ (pure IPC contract) + core/ (pure logic: status-mapper, reducers, migrations, correlator, throttle, keybinding-router, and new cycle-6 pure modules: commands/registry, commands/fuzzy, explorer/tree-nav) + main/ (thin Electron adapters + platform/ seams) + preload/ (typed bridge) + renderer/ (React+zustand; new CommandPalette/KeyboardHelp overlays + region-focus hook). PTY lives in main; renderer is a view over main's truth."
  - testing: "vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 (95%/90% thresholds), node + jsdom projects; pure logic via injected fakes; Playwright-for-Electron E2E incl. a keyboard-only (no .click()) mouseless journey."
  - stack: "TypeScript, Electron 34 + electron-vite 3, pnpm, React 19 + Vite 6, zustand 5, xterm.js 5.5, chokidar 4, electron-store 10, monaco 0.52, zod 3, node-pty; @fontsource chakra-petch + jetbrains-mono (cyberpunk theme). No new runtime deps planned for cycle 6 (fuzzy match hand-rolled + pure)."

# ── Expansion Cycle 6 (Leap 34+) — Mouseless / keyboard-only navigation ──
# Operator END GOAL: keyboard-only operation of all of Weft. OUT OF SCOPE: macOS/Linux, split panes/LSP.
# Plan (each ~1 leap): (35) router chords + passthrough guard; (36) pure command registry + fuzzy;
# (37) command palette overlay + wire actions; (38) keyboard help overlay; (39) region-focus system +
# :focus-visible styling all themes; (40) pure tree-nav + explorer roving tabindex; (41) tab reorder/
# rename(F2)/type by keyboard; (42) viewer mode switches + app-level Ctrl+S; (43) status controls via
# commands; (44) mouseless E2E journey + focus-ring/passthrough E2E; then Phase 4 review, convergence,
# checkpoint. Spec: documents/steiner-spec.md ## Expansion 6. Design: documents/keyboard-navigation.md.
